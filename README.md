This article discusses the fast growth of Florida's population. Florida, the 27th state to join the Union in 1845, experienced remarkable demographic transformations, growing from a population of 34,730 in 1830 to 54,477 in 1840, an increase of 50 percent. The purpose of this article is to highlight the impressive 78.7% increase in population, reaching 4,951,560 in 1960. In the following decades, Florida's population growth slowed, with an increase by 17.6% between 2000 and 2010, bringing the population to 18,801,310 inhabitants. However, the state's population continued to increase steadily, reaching 20,271,272 in 2015. Projections indicated that Florida's population was on track to surpass 22 million by the 2020 census and could potentially exceed 26 million by 2030. This growth was due to significant immigration from the northern states. This migration has played a central role in Florida's population dynamics, with approximately two-thirds of its residents born in other states. Additionally, Florida has one of the largest Hispanic populations in the country, comprising more than 1 million residents. Florida's demographic makeup reflects a rich mosaic of races, with a white population of 67.71%, followed by black or African American (15.74%), two or more races (9.38%), other races (4.06%), Asians (2.8%). , Native American (0.26%), and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (0.06%). However, despite Florida's economic growth and prosperity, Florida faces challenges, including a poverty rate of 13.11%. Nonetheless, Florida's vibrant culture, abundant economic opportunities and natural attractions continue to make it an attractive destination for residents and visitors alike.
